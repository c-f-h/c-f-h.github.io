Welcome! This is a blog on some of my side projects.
My background is in computational mathematics, numerical linear algebra
and some computational geometry, but these projects lean heavily
towards machine learning.

I use LLM-based tools quite liberally on these side projects for
brainstorming and implementation, but the writing on this blog is
all my own.

Projects:
- [Connect-Zero: Reinforcement Learning from Scratch]({{< relref "categories/connect-zero" >}}) ([intro post]({{< relref "post/connect-zero" >}}))
- [The Triangle Project]({{< relref "categories/the-triangle-project" >}}) ([intro post]({{< relref "post/the-triangle-problem" >}}))
